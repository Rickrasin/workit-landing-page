## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I feel like I learned how to structure an html and css page the right way.

I just feel kind of disappointed in myself for having done something, in my mind, wrong.
If you notice, the background with curved border was made with a width of 200%, I had to remove the horizontal bar from the page for it not to appear.

Another mistake I feel like I made, was not having the right proportions on the page.

### Continued development

I intend to do 2 more short projects, however this time using Javascript to implement a feature.
After these, I will practice my ReactJS with small projects.
